This is a screenshot containing the stub code that I wrote for grades. Once I added it to the original code of 
Assignment 2. I noticed that there were some bugs. This is likely a result of different inputs types, Assignment 2
and this lab have different inputs. This program expects indicula lab marks for 6 labs which were not included in the assingment, and vice versa some of the inputs that assignment 2 needs aren't inlcuded within the lab's inputs.

Moving onto Twitter, thorugh the use of EasyMock syntax I was able to follow the test case requirements to create
mock tests as required. Below are the testcases that I created.<img width="392" alt="Screen Shot 2021-07-02 at 1 34 40 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36574103/124310493-452b8c00-db3a-11eb-9924-168fc1e594a1.png">

For part of the lab, computation.
I was having errors with using Jacoco on Eclipse and IntelliJ, likley because I'm using MacOs.

I still did my best to resolve this issue and try with IntelliJ, I still got similar errors.

Although I coundl't run coverage tests, I still went over the Computation.java file and did similar white
box testing practices in order to make the code run efficiently.

For part 2 of the lab, I didn't make any changes due to not eing able to correctly run Jacoco, I still anlayzed the file
and hypothezied whether 100% is possible. I do think it is possible but it would require numerouse
testcases, many of which would not be neccessary as the current testcases handle exceptions and the logic
well. Inproving coveraage is possible but would be unneccessary sine 100% coverage doesn't necessarily mean
that it will always run prefectly.
